## The Concept of an Accessibility Knowledge Hub

### What is an Accessibility Knowledge Hub?

A centralized space that serves as a library of information on accessibility, intended to educate and support stakeholders in understanding and implementing accessibility best practices. It can be designed for internal or external audiences, or as a hybrid. The hub aims to provide a single source of information, making it easier for users to find resources quickly.

### The Mission

The metaphor of the *USS Enterprise* from *Star Trek* was used to describe accessibility as an ongoing mission, ensuring that the vast possibilities of digital content are accessible to everyone. The goal is to create an inclusive space where all individuals, regardless of their abilities, can thrive.

## Examples of Accessibility Knowledge Hubs

### Internal Knowledge Hub at CBC/Radio-Canada

This bilingual hub includes over 170 articles on various accessibility topics like making advertisements accessible, designing for diverse user needs, and more. The content is organized by filters such as recent updates and specific topics to ensure easy access. Learn more about [CBC/Radio-Canada's accessibility initiatives](https://www.cbc.ca/accessibility/).

### MaGeTA (Inclusive Design Research Centre)

An open-source platform offering accessibility checklists for web and native apps. It focuses on practical guidelines for product developers and designers. For more information, visit the [Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC)](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/).

### Humber College's Public and Internal Hub

Aimed at content creators and media professionals, this hub focuses on making real-time events and conferences accessible, catering to different needs through public access and integration with internal learning systems.

## Why Create an Accessibility Knowledge Hub

### Four Core Goals

1. **Learning**: Helps users apply best practices and understand accessibility in their specific roles.
2. **Autonomy**: Allows users to access information quickly and independently without needing to search through multiple sources.
3. **Centralized Information**: Provides a one-stop shop for all accessibility resources, helping set standards across an organization.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Encourages feedback from users to keep content relevant and updated.

## Building Your Own Accessibility Knowledge Hub

### Steps to Build a Knowledge Hub

1. **Identify Your Audience**: Determine if the hub is for internal use, external partners, or both. Tailor content based on the needs of users—technical for developers or simplified for clients.
2. **Define the Content**: Based on the audience, decide what types of information to include—technical guides, best practices, checklists, or general advice.
3. **Choose the Right Platform**: Platforms range from simple and free options like Google Sites to more robust and secure options like Confluence, depending on team size, budget, and content needs.
4. **Write and Structure the Content**: Assign subject matter experts to create content and decide on the structure, such as a wiki or a more traditional website layout.
5. **Publish and Promote**: Once content is ready, make it available to users and promote its existence through training sessions and internal communications.

## Challenges and Impact

### Lessons from CBC/Radio-Canada’s Experience

Since launching in June, the knowledge hub has centralized over 300 pages of content, streamlining access to accessibility resources for employees. Although it’s early to gauge full adoption, initial feedback has been positive, highlighting how it has become a go-to resource for accessibility queries.

Continuous promotion is necessary to increase awareness and ensure the hub becomes a standard reference point for accessibility-related questions.
