### Building the Case for a Vendor Monitoring Program:

#### Why It's Needed:

- Vendor products must align with an organization’s accessibility standards since users often can't distinguish between the core product and third-party integrations.
- It's crucial to validate vendor claims about accessibility to ensure they meet the desired user experience.
- Accessibility experts should be involved in the procurement process to avoid accessibility becoming “no one’s responsibility.”

#### Business, Ethical, and Legal Imperatives:

- Addressing accessibility is not only a business case but also an ethical and legal one, ensuring access to digital experiences for all users.
- It's also important for fostering an inclusive work environment and ensuring that tools used by employees are accessible.
- Jaunita emphasizes that if leadership support is lacking, it’s possible to start small and build a culture of accessibility through grassroots efforts.

### Designing a Vendor Monitoring Program:

#### Program Components:

- **Assemble a Team**: Include relationship managers, contract managers, and accessibility engineers who can handle different aspects of accessibility and procurement.
- **Define Scope**: Distinguish between public-facing and internal applications, focusing on high-impact areas like portals, training tools, and internal apps that staff need to perform their jobs.
- **Inventory Vendors**: Maintain a database of vendors that includes details like audit results, documentation of fixes, and internal points of contact.
- **Develop Accessible Procurement Policies**: Include statements of commitment, testing requirements, and clear consequences for non-compliance in contracts. Refer to the [Disability:IN Procurement Toolkit](https://disabilityin.org/procurementtoolkit/) for guidance on creating accessible procurement policies.

#### Contract Management:

- Include detailed accessibility testing requirements and specify the responsibilities of the vendor.
- Ensure that people with disabilities are part of the testing and feedback process.
- Use templates tailored to different types of vendor services, such as content creation or software platforms.

### Monitoring and Maintaining Compliance:

#### Validation and Audits:

- Always verify vendors' Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs), ensuring audits are recent and performed by qualified, independent third parties. Learn more about [VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat) used to create ACRs.
- Use smoke testing—quick, light tests—to regularly check accessibility compliance, especially after updates.
- Develop vendor-specific monitoring plans, including regular audits and a process for addressing non-conformance.

#### Building Relationships and Training:

- Relationships with procurement, risk, cybersecurity, and legal teams are essential to navigate the complexities of vendor management.
- Training programs should raise awareness about accessibility standards and best practices, emphasizing the human impact of accessible digital experiences.
- Engage procurement in internal accessibility-focused groups or initiatives to help them understand the importance.

### Handling Non-Compliance and Escalation:

#### Addressing Issues:

- For non-compliant vendors, establish a remediation roadmap and ensure fixes are validated before considering them resolved.
- Have a clear breach and escalation process for situations where vendors refuse to comply or provide necessary documentation.
- Develop contingency plans for potential contract terminations, ensuring there are alternative vendors or solutions in place.

#### Ongoing Engagement:

- Maintain regular communication with vendors, approaching them as partners in creating accessible products.
- Understand that many vendors may lack in-house accessibility expertise and be prepared to offer guidance and support.
- Track metrics and provide regular reports to demonstrate the value and impact of the vendor monitoring program.

### Final Insights:

#### Building a Culture of Accessibility:

- Success in vendor monitoring programs is closely tied to shifting company culture towards prioritizing accessibility.
- Metrics and continuous education play a key role in showing value and gaining long-term buy-in.

#### Collaboration and Persistence:

- Establishing these processes takes time and requires persistence, but with a collaborative approach, organizations can push vendors and internal teams towards better accessibility practices.

### Resources Mentioned:

#### Tools for Building Programs:

- [Disability:IN Procurement Toolkit](https://disabilityin.org/procurementtoolkit/), and [Section 508 documentation](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/).
- Jaunita also provided contact information and recommended joining the Web A11y Slack for networking and support.
