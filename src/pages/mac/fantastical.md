title: Why I need Fantastical application
---

I work with external clients like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other organizations outside of the Government of Canada departments for which I use with my personal calendar 

These different organization use different meeting platforms.

I need to have all my calendars (personal and work) merged into one. I use calendars and reminders to help me with my day to day tasks.  

I use my **work** calendar (in Fantastical) to keep track of the time I spend on work and colour code it depending on the project. 

## Benefits of using Fantastical

- Integrated different virtual meeting calling options that allows me to connect to applications in my calendar (Zoom, Google meet and Teams).
  - When creating a Zoom or Teams meeting it will add the information into the event for participants automatically.
  - [Conference Calls.](https://flexibits.com/fantastical#conference-calls-section)
- Integrated MacOS reminders in the calendar.

- Option to notify upcoming events up to a minute before, five minutes in the other apps is too far away and time of the meeting start doesn't allow me to finish what I'm doing. My reminders are set to 15 minutes before and Fantastical lets me snooze it to one minute before.

- Third Party Calendar Support is much better in Fantastical than in the native Mac Mail application.
  - Outlook categories support (colours are the same in Outlook and in Fantastical), helps me remember my colour when switching to Outlook)
- Adding an event is uses simple text into text box like "meet on April 29 for Shawn's birthday at 18:00 at McDonalds on Peel" would add an event called Shawn's birthday, with the time 6PM, date April 29 and the McDonalds address on Peel.
  - Uses the Mac Maps' app to find the address

- Allows you to duplicate an event to another calendar and it only shows up as one event when viewing all your calendars.
  - This allows me to duplicate an event into my **work** outlook calendar but doesn't show up as two separate events in my calendar.

- When using an Exchange email it connects to the active name directory to is searches for emails in the organization, as well as contacts in the Mac contact apps for when inviting people to meeting events.
- Converting time zones easier to schedule international calls with the W3C. Doable in Outlook but not Apple Mail.
- Able to set dark mode and not relying on the system settings to set it, I use dark mode on my calendar because it's always visible on my screen and doesn't distract my attention as much.
