---

## Target

- 16–17 L into fermenter (5 gal corny safe fill)
- OG: 1.064–1.066
- FG: 1.010–1.012
- ABV: ~6.8%
- IBU: ~45
- Fermentation temp: steady ~20°C

## Day Before Brew Day

- Rinse BrewZilla and run water through pump and valve
- Measure **15 L strike water**
- Measure **8.5–9 L sparge water**
- Add **4 mL lactic acid (88%) to strike water**
- Add **2 mL lactic acid (88%) to sparge water**
- Stir thoroughly
- Let sit loosely covered overnight

Fermenter prep:

- Install **floating dip tube**
- Lightly lube all O-rings
- Pressure test keg at 10–15 PSI
- Sanitize keg before filling
- Sanitize and prepare **Tilt hydrometer**

## Mash

### Strike & Mash-In

- Heat **15 L strike water to 72°C**
- Add grains slowly while stirring:

  - 5.0 kg Pale Malt
  - 0.5 kg Munich
  - 0.3 kg Vienna
  - 0.2 kg Crystal 40

- Recirculate gently (bottom to top)
- Stabilize at **66–67°C**
- Start **60-minute mash timer**

### Mash Temperature Verification (10–15 min)

1. Turn pump OFF
2. Insert INKBIRD probe into middle of grain bed
3. Wait 5–10 seconds
4. Record temp
5. Restart pump

If:

- 66–67°C → perfect
- 65°C → increase set temp by 1°C
- <65°C → increase set temp by 1.5°C

Stir at:

- 20 minutes
- Before mash-out

Raise to **76°C for 10-minute mash-out**

## Lauter & Sparge

- Lift malt pipe and drain fully
- Heat sparge water to **80°C**
- Gently sparge with **8.5–9 L**
- Target **23–24 L pre-boil volume**

If volume is high, extend boil 10–15 minutes.

## Boil – 60 Minutes

Start timer once boil begins.

### 60 min

- 20 g Simcoe

### 20 min

- 25 g Simcoe

### 10 min

- 40 g Simcoe
- Dissolve **0.25 kg dextrose** in ~500 mL hot wort, then add back
- Add 1 Whirlfloc tablet
- Add yeast nutrient (pinch)

## Whirlpool / Hop Stand

- Chill wort to **80°C**
- Add **50 g Simcoe**
- Whirlpool gently
- Hold at 80°C for **20 minutes**

## Chill & Transfer to Fermenter

- Chill to **18–19°C**
- Add sanitized **Tilt hydrometer** to keg
- Transfer **16–17 L max** into fermentation corny
- Measure OG
- Oxygenate by shaking
- Pitch **2 packs US-05**
- Purge headspace 3 times with CO₂
- Attach blowoff tube

## Fermentation (Closet ~20°C)

Days 0–3:

- Maintain ~20°C
- Blowoff only

Day 3–4 (after high krausen slows):

- Replace blowoff with spunding valve
- Set to **10–12 PSI**

## Dry Hop (Day 5 or Near Final Gravity)

- Add **60 g Simcoe** in sanitized hop bag
- Add 2–3 sanitized stainless nuts/weights inside bag
- Ensure bag is not tightly packed
- Close lid quickly
- Purge headspace 3 times with CO₂
- Reattach spunding valve (10–12 PSI)

Dry hop contact:

- 3–4 days at 20°C max

## Cold Crash

When gravity is stable for 2 days:

- Move keg to keezer at **2–3°C**
- Connect CO₂ at **5–8 PSI**
- Cold crash **24–48 hours**

Do not rely on spunding alone during crash.

## Closed Transfer (Cold-to-Cold)

Day before transfer:

- Place serving keg in keezer
- Fill completely with Star San
- Push out sanitizer with CO₂ through liquid post
- Leave keg sealed and pressurized (5–10 PSI)

Transfer:

- Liquid post → Liquid post
- Apply **2–5 PSI** to fermenter
- Slightly pull PRV on receiving keg
- Stop transfer if haze appears in line

Leave Tilt in fermenter.

## Force Carbonation

Option 1 (faster):

- 30 PSI for 24 hours
- Reduce to 10–12 PSI

Option 2 (gentler):

- 12 PSI at 2–3°C for 5–6 days
