## New fresh day

The following list shows what a startup is like for me when my MacMini was shut down. Reading it, you will understand why I don't like to shut my Mac down very often. Doing this on a Windows system takes a lot more energy and hacking and still doesn't work as expected or as smooth as a MacMini M1 in MacOS.

1. Turn on MacMini
2. Put on Airpod Max
3. Log into MacOS
4. Run `Launch all.app` found in left corner on desktop, which launches the following application
   1. On secondary monitor:
      1. Fantastical
      2. Reminders
      3. Home.app
      4. Music
   2. On main monitor
      1. Safari (all windows and tabs that were left open)
      2. Slack
      3. Messages
      4. Obsidian (which opens on every desktop on the right monitor)
      5. Mailmate
5. Run `Start work.app` found in left corner on desktop, which launches the following application:
   1. On main monitor
   2. Outlook
   3. Teams
   4. VS Code
   5. iTerm (preferred terminal but Mac Terminal is good enough for my SSC work)
6. Window placement, MacOS does a good job remembering which monitor an app was on when shut down, just not what desktop. Using `Better touch tool.app` I've defined specific sizes and placement on each desktop for most of my application windows. Obsidian application shows up on every desktop window I have on the right monitor.
   1. Secondary monitor Desktop 1:
      1. Fantastical
      2. Reminders
   2. Secondary monitor Desktop 2:
       1. Home
   3. Secondary monitor Desktop 3:
       1. Music
   4. Secondary monitor Desktop 4:
       1. Safari browser window used for anything I need to reference throughout the day
   5. Main monitor Desktop 1 (code name **Code**):
       1. VS Code
       2. Safari browser window
       3. Obsidian
   6. Main monitor Desktop 2 (code name **Comms**):
       1. MS Teams
       2. Slack
       3. Messages
       4. Safari window
       5. Obsidian
   7. Main monitor Desktop 3 (code name **Mail**):
       1. Outlook
       2. Mailmate (preferred mail app)
       3. Safari window
       4. Obsidian
   8. Main monitor Desktop 4 (code name **W3C**):
       1. Zoom
       2. IRC
       3. Safari window
       4. Obsidian
7. Planning my day
    1. Switch to Obsidian on **Mail** desktop
       1. Switch to Outlook's calendar
       2. Make sure all calendar events are both in Work and personal calendar
       3. Create new daily note in Obsidian
          1. Copy unfinished task from previous daily note
          2. Create a list of meetings for that day and a note for each meeting
          3. Copy the agenda of each meeting into each note
       4. Outlook: Check emails, reply, pin to top or mark in Obsidian tasks as reminders
       5. Safari: Check GitHub notifications see if there's anything to action, if so add to tasks in Obsidian
    2. Switch to **Comms** desktop
        1. Check Teams for messages and notifications
        2. Reply to any messages
        3. Use Obsidian to take notes of any tasks
8. Start working

### Working on different tasks

#### Research / Advising

Main monitor desktops (**Comms** and **Mail**)

Secondary monitor: Fantastical and Reminders

Environment: Headphones on music playing softly (lower than system sound), SSC iPad visible for notifications from emails or Teams. Using MacOS [Spoken content](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph96b214f0/ios) to read information.

- Work coming in many different ways, could be in a chat in Teams, could be email, from ongoing tasks (saved for later)
- Usually involving searching the internet for information on different accessibility topics in Safari, emails or conversations had in the accessibility Slack workspace.

#### Developing

Main monitor desktops (**Code** and **Comms**)

Secondary monitor: Different application depending on the tasks. Often used as reference with Word, Safari, Teams chat when working with someone.

Environment: Headphones on music playing softly (lower than system sound), SSC iPad visible for notifications from emails or Teams. Using MacOS [Spoken content](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph96b214f0/ios) to read information.

- Work usually found in Safari on Github, in tasks (saved for later), discussions on Teams or in emails.
- Open VS Code where I left off and continue working or take on new issue / task.

#### Participating in Work Groups / Meetings

##### W3C

Main monitor desktops (**W3C**)

Environment: Headphones on in conference call, SSC iPad visible for notifications from emails or Teams. Using MacOS [Spoken content](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph96b214f0/ios) to read information.

- Open Safari, Zoom, Textual (IRC), Obsidian applications needed to participate in the meeting. Taking notes in Obsidian and interacting in IRC during the calls.
- Using Safari to open links shared during the call, working on collaborating Google Docs, leaving tabs open for stuff to read later.

## Stepping away from desk

1. Lock MacOs leaving everything open that I was working on. 
2. Take off AirPods

### While I'm away

If I think of anything I need to do at my desk when I return I usually ask Siri (over my Apple Watch, iPhone, HomePods throughout my appartment) to remind me or even have access to Obsidian on my phone where I can add it to my daily task list.

## Returning to Mac

1. Put on AirPods
2. Turn toward Mac 
3. Unlocks with my Apple Watch. No password to enter! Thanks Apple!
4. Return to what I was doing, sometimes leaving notes in Obsidian about what I was doing (if I remember)
5. Check reminders to see if I added anything

## End of day

1. Take notes of what I was working on and what needs to be continued the next day in Obsidian
2. Reveal desktop
3. Run `EndWork.app` to close:
   1. Teams
   2. Outlook

## Notes

- There was a way to assign an application to specific desktop in MacOS but it seems to only allow either the first or second desktop and I use a few others.
- If I get a Teams, Slack or text notification that I need to respond to right away I can use my horizontal mouse wheel to switch between desktops quickly and back without breaking too much my concentration.
- I wish I had a way to lower the volume (or even mute) of Teams / Zoom calls when I'm using MacOS [Spoken content](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph96b214f0/ios) to read information.
- Every so once and awhile (2 weeks) open Safari > Window > Merge all windows, which merges all my open Safari windows and tabs into one window and I recreate my different Safari windows for my different desktops closing tabs I don't need anymore.
- Sometime I have to reorganize my desktops in Mission control, a little annoying but easy enough to do with my mouse shortcuts. I just figured out that I can move a desktop from one monitor to another one (as long as it's not the active desktop).
