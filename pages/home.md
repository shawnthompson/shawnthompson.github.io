Shawn is a Digital Accessibility Technical Advisor for the Canadian Government, a certified [Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification), an invited member in the [W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/participants) and the co-chair for People with Disabilities network within his department.  

Shawn is passionate about creating awareness of the lived experiences of People with Disabilities. 

Shawn's career in the public service has spanned over 15 years. His previous roles have always supported digital accessibility, with a strong focus on web publishing, web development and accessibility testing for the web. 

After working in the public service for 10 years with a hidden cognitive disability, Shawn courageously chose to disclose his disability status. He started requesting the job supports and accommodations needed to help him particularly the memory retention barriers he faces everyday living with a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
